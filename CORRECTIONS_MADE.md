# Flappy Bird Game Corrections

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. **Memory Leak Fix**
- **Problem**: Pipes were continuously added to the ArrayList but never removed when they went off-screen, causing memory usage to grow indefinitely.
- **Solution**: Added logic to remove pipes that have moved completely off-screen (`pipe.x + pipe.width < 0`).
- **Location**: `move()` method in FlappyBird.java

### 2. **Improved Game State Management**
- **Problem**: The game didn't have a proper start state, and restart logic could be triggered multiple times.
- **Solution**: Added `gameStarted` boolean flag to control when the game actually begins moving.
- **Features Added**:
  - Game shows "Press SPACE to start" message initially
  - Game only starts moving when space is pressed for the first time
  - Proper separation between game start, gameplay, and restart states

### 3. **Better Collision Detection**
- **Problem**: Bird could hit the top of the screen without triggering game over.
- **Solution**: Added explicit check for bird hitting the top boundary (`bird.y <= 0`).

### 4. **Enhanced User Interface**
- **Problem**: Limited feedback to the player about game state.
- **Solution**: 
  - Added "Press SPACE to restart" message when game is over
  - Added "Press SPACE to start" message at game beginning
  - Made score text bold for better visibility

### 5. **Improved Pipe Generation**
- **Problem**: Original pipe positioning logic could create impossible gaps or inconsistent spacing.
- **Solution**: Rewrote pipe placement algorithm with better bounds checking to ensure:
  - Consistent gap size between top and bottom pipes
  - Pipes always have a passable opening
  - More predictable difficulty curve

### 6. **Better Input Handling**
- **Problem**: Space key would cause jumping even during game over state.
- **Solution**: Restructured key handling to:
  - Only allow jumping during active gameplay
  - Use space for game start when not started
  - Use space for restart when game is over

### 7. **Timer Management**
- **Problem**: Pipe generation timer started immediately, creating pipes before game started.
- **Solution**: Pipe timer now only starts when the game actually begins or restarts.

### 8. **Code Cleanup**
- **Problem**: Commented out code and inconsistent formatting.
- **Solution**: 
  - Removed unnecessary commented line in App.java
  - Improved code organization and readability

## Technical Improvements:

1. **Reverse iteration** in pipe processing to safely remove elements from ArrayList
2. **Proper state management** with clear separation of game states
3. **Memory efficiency** by cleaning up off-screen objects
4. **Better user experience** with clear instructions and feedback
5. **Robust restart mechanism** that properly resets all game state

## Files Modified:
- `App.java`: Removed commented code
- `FlappyBird.java`: Major improvements to game logic, state management, and user interface

The game now provides a much better user experience with proper state management, no memory leaks, and clear visual feedback for all game states.
